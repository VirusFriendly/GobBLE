This Jupyter notebook analyzes the RaMBLE database to enumerate new BLE devices and technologies that the analyst may wish to investigate, by reporting device indicators not previously recorded.

This notebook depends on the database exported by [RaMBLE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.contextis.android.BLEScanner), a passive BLE scanner for Android devices.

Export the RaMBLE database and copy it to the location with the notebook as `RaMBLE.sqlite` and then use the Jupyter notebook as normal.
